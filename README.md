# xpath

Our XPath implementation in TypeScript.

## Motivation

We maintain another open source package called [`xslt-processor`](https://github.com/DesignLiquido/xslt-processor). The XPath component the project had became impossible to maintain due to a variety of reasons. `xslt-processor` should use this implementation once it is ready. 

This repository is intended to solve a particular problem in our packages, but it can be used by any other NPM package.
